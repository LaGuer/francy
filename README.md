# Francy
FRANCY is a Framework for Interactive Discrete Mathematics package for GAP.

Unlike XGAP, Francy is not linked with any GUI framework and instead, this package is responsible for the generation 
of Semantic Graphical Objects that can be used to produce Graphical Objects, using external libraries, e.g. _Francy - JS_ 
a javascript implementation module.
