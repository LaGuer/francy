    Francy arose from the necessity of having a lightweight framework forbuilding interactive graphics, generated from GAP, running primarily on theweb, primarily in a Jupyter Notebook. An initial attempt to re-use XGAP andport it was made, but the lack of
    a standardized data exchange format betweenGAP and the graphics renderer, and the simplistic initial requirements of the project were the basis for the creation of a new GAP package.

    <Heading>Installation</Heading>

    This package requires &Jupyter; to be installed on your system, which on most Python installations can be achieved by issuing the following command.

    <Log>
      > pip install notebook
    </Log>
    Further instructions can be found at
    <URL>https://jupyter.org/install</URL>. This package requires the &GAP; packages &JupyterKernel; and &json;, all of which are distributed with &GAP;. In order to nistall &Francy;, please follow the instructions:
    <Log>
      user@local:~$ pip install jupyter_francy
    </Log>
    <Log>
      user@local:~$ jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix jupyter_francy
    </Log>

    <Heading>How it works</Heading>

    &Francy; requires a rendering package to display graphics. Francy uses Renderers based on d3.js and Graphviz, for rendering the semantic representation produced by the GAP package. This library is distributed both as a browser module and as a Jupyter
    extension. The Jupyter extension can be used in Jupyter Notebooks or Jupyter Lab, using the &JupyterKernel; and the MIME type application/vnd.francy+json to render the document
